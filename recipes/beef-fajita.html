    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <div class="section">
      <ol>
        <li><strong>STEAK MARINADE:</strong> Combine the ingredients for the marinade in a large shallow bowl. 
          Give it a taste and check for seasonings, adjust to preference. Coat the steak with the 
          marinade and let sit covered in the refrigerator for at least 2-4 hours and ideally overnight.
           Remove from the refrigerator 30 minute prior to cooking.</li>
        <li>
          Set a large cast iron skillet or pan over high heat and let heat up for a couple of minutes. 
          Add the steak to the pan and fry on each side for about 3-5 minutes or longer if you'd like it 
          more done. Feel for desired firmness. The 3 minutes/side will yield a medium rare doneness. 
          If the pan becomes too hot, reduce the heat to medium high. Remove the steak from the pan and 
          allow to rest for several minutes tented with a piece of foil. Slice the meat against the grain 
          into thin slices. I like to do so on an angle so the meat slices are tender and thin.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>FAJITA VEGGIES:</strong> Add the remaining tablespoon of oil to the pan over high heat, add in the onions, 
          poblano, and bell peppers. Let the veggies begin to sizzle and toss as necessary, cook for a total 
          of 2-3 minutes or longer if you prefer them softer, season with a pinch of salt and pepper. <strong>If your 
            pan is small, cook the veggies in a few batches so they don't steam.</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>ASSEMBLY:</strong> Serve them in tortillas or on rice bowls topped with your favorite toppings!
