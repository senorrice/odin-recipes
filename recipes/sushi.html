                The classic spicy tuna roll is a relatively simple, yet delicious way to prepare
                different cuts of tuna while introducing a mild, spicy taste. The tuna is diced and
                mixed together with a spicy sauce then prepared in a tube of sushi rice.

            <li>4 oz of sashimi-grade tuna</li>
            <li>2 sheets of nori dried seaweed</li>
            <li>2 green onions</li>

          </ul>
        </div>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <div class="section">
          <ol>
            <li>Gather all the ingredients. Note: Cooking time is not including the time for making sushi rice. 
              For a complete guide to make sushi rice, please check sushi rice recipe. 
              Important: Cover the sushi rice with a damp cloth at all times to prevent it from drying. 
              Cover your bamboo sushi mat with plastic.
            </li>
            <li>
              Make vinegar water for dipping fingers (Tezu) by combining ¼ cup (4 Tbsp) water and 2 tsp rice vinegar in a small bowl. 
              Dipping your fingers prevents rice from sticking to them.
            </li>
            <li>
              Cut the tuna into ¼" (0.5 cm) cubes (or you can mince the tuna).
            </li>
            <li>
              In a medium bowl, combine the tuna, Sriracha sauce, sesame oil, and some green onion (save some for topping).
            </li>
            <li>
              Lay a sheet of half nori, shiny side down, on the bamboo mat. Wet your fingers in Tezu and spread ¾ cup of the rice 
              evenly onto the nori sheet. Sprinkle the rice with sesame seeds.
            </li>
            <li>
              Turn the sheet of nori over so that the rice side is facing down. Line the edge of the nori sheet at the bottom 
              end of the bamboo mat. Place half of the tuna mixture at the bottom end of the nori sheet.
            </li>
            <li>
              Grab the bottom edge of the bamboo mat while keeping the fillings in place with your fingers, roll into a tight cylinder. 
              Lift the edge of the bamboo mat and continue to roll it forward while keeping gentle pressure on the mat.
            </li>
            <li>
              With a very sharp knife, cut the roll in half and then cut each half into 3 pieces. Clean the knife with a damp cloth every 
              few cuts. When you cut sushi rolls, dip your fingers in Tezu or cover the roll with plastic, so the rice won't stick to your 
              hands.
            </li>
            <li>
              Put a dollop of spicy mayo on top of each sushi and garnish with the remaining green onion.
            </li>
