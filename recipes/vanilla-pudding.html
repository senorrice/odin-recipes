    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <div class="section">
      <ul>
        <li>1 (14 oz.) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>1.5 cups ice cold water</li>
        <li>1 (3.4 oz.) box vanilla instant pudding mix (Jello brand)</li>
        <li>3 cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>4 cups sliced barely ripe bananas</li>
        <li>1 (12 oz.) box Nilla Wafers</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <div class="section">
      <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, beat together the sweetened condensed milk and water until well combined - about
           1 minute. Add the pudding mix and beat well - about 2 minutes. Cover and refrigerate for 3-4 hours 
           or overnight. It is very important to allow the proper amount of time for the pudding mixture to
            set. It will be watery if you don't let it set up long enough.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, whip the heavy cream until stiff peaks form. Gently fold the whipped cream into 
          the pudding mixture until no streaks of pudding remain.</li>
        <li>Dessert can either be made in individual portions or in a large glass bowl with 4-5 quart capacity 
          (a 9x13 baking dish also works).</li>
        <li>To assemble dessert, arrange 1/3 of the Nilla wafers covering the bottom, overlapping if necessary. 
          Next, layer 1/3 of the bananas, and 1/3 of the pudding mixture. Repeat twice more, garnishing with 
          additional wafers or wafer crumbs on the top layer. Cover tightly and allow to chill in the fridge 
          for at least 4 hours - or up to 8 hours, no longer (because bananas will start to brown - see Notes 
          for tips on preventing browning).</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <div class="section">
      <p>The reason the recipe says to serve within 8 hours is that the bananas will turn brown as they oxidize. 
      There are a couple of things you can do to make not brown as fast:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <ol>
        <li>Pick bananas that are barely ripe. If they are slightly green and the stem, those are perfect. 
          These will tend to brown as fast.</li>
        <li>Brush them with some lemon juice. Any fruit juice helps (pineapple, apple, orange). This can change 
          the flavor slightly so brushing them is better than soaking them. Even water neutralizes the ph and 
          will slow down the browning if you rinse them in water.</li>
        <li>Rinse them with club soda. The advantage here is that it won't affect the taste. 
          Don't use tonic as it has a bad taste.</li>
        <li>Try to keep them airtight. The less contact with the air the less they will brown.</li>
      </ol>
